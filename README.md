Photo-Annotator is a photo management application that derives information of location, daylight, weather, event name, and persons related to a photo through external application programming interfaces (API) and libraries from the respective image's metadata. Photos can be sought & viewed efficiently through these information i.e. the location or event on which a particular photo was taken.
